app data flow [spec,endpoint,controller, service, facade]
1. we have a location that needs to get geocoded
2. once its geocoded by google geocode api we will have lat & long values(geocodeservice)
3. we need the lat & long values to be passed into the darksky api request
4. this will get us weather data for our location(darksky service)
5. now that we have weather data for our location from the darksky api service
we need to make a poro to get the data out that we want.
according to the mockup, we need to get data from
our :currently, :hourly and :daily keys in our darksky return data.

:currently poro
:hourly poro
:daily poro
and we need a presenter to delegate getting this data and presenting it.


parsed_darksky_response_data (is the method to initialize these poros)
